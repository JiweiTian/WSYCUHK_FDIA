Locational Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Smart Grid: a Multi-label Classification Approach

This is the code and data for the paper "Locational Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Smart Grid: a Multi-label Classification Approach".

Any question, please feel free to contact us through Github or email.


The Keras code used in the paper can be find in '/Code/...', where you can also the Tensorflow Approach.
Other files are other methods, such as MLP, for testing usage. If you are interested, you can still try those codes for fun.
