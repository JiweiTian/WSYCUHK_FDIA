CalculateF1.py and CNNfor118BusSystem.py are Keras approaches.

cnn_kernal_wsy.py and cnn_main.py are Tensorflow approaches.

In our experiment, Keras apporaches run much faster than Tensorflow approaches. As a result, the presented data in the paper is based on Keras apporaches.

The detail implementation will be publiced when the paper is public.
